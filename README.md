# JSWpredictionmodel
Property prediction model.
While interning at JSW worked on a property prediction model. The main focus was on how to predict the property of the product being produced without manual testing of the material which requires extensive care, a lot of time, and manual effort by the engineers and workers. This project was an approach to increase the efficiency of the plant testing model. The prediction model used Gradient boosting XGB now earlier we used Multi regression model, but later switched to increase the efficiency and effort. The model also retrieves the database using MySQL queries on the on-premises database containing around 300 parameters. Out of the 300 parameters, 15 parameters are retrieved using SQL queries from the data frame, this  parameter election is done either by backward selection, pPV value(confidence of prediction), feature importance(decision-based model), or dimensionality reduction which is the most efficient of all.
